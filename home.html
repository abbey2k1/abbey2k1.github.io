<h2>a formal introduction</h2>
<p>
  hi, my name is abbey and this is my personal corner of the internet. born and raised in west virginia in the united states, i've lived at very big highs and extreme lows, but i've began to learn what it is to live my own life. this site serves to be a spot where i can talk about things that interest me, trouble me, and excite me. modern social media has not fulfilled me in these desires to unapologetically share myself with the internet, so I shall do it here. 
</p>
<p>
  i am a transgender woman, born in 2001, and am an aspiring musician and producer of sorts. currently i'm very much into the NFL and american football, and i am a diehard washington commanders fan (fuck dallas). i'm also an avid sim racer, primarily racing on platforms such as iRacing, NR2003, and whatever else comes my way. 
</p>

<p>
  i try to update this site as often as i can, but i am very ADHD-brained so there may be month(s)-long gaps between updates. enjoy your stay ‚ù§

<h3>song of the week: vienna - billy joel</h3>

<p>a very overlooked song on wings at the speed of sound, released in 1976. the atmosphere, mysterious vibe, and vocal mixing makes this song feel so damn fresh even in 2025. also that guitar solo, one of the best from the late jimmy mcculloch. the little touch of chorus on the latter bit of the solo is just, perfection. this song deserves so much more praise than it gets these days.</p>
