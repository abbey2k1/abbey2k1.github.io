<p>if you felt the need to know more about me, you're in luck! i can pretty much talk about whatever to whoever so oversharing is not something i'm particularly ever worried about. plus on this site, you are getting the full me. no sugarcoating, this is 100% my own self. that's the cool thing about being transgender, i get to actually be <i>me</i>.</p>

<h2>ok but like, who actually are you?</h2>
